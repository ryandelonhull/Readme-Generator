Thank you to Roger, Kerwin, Manuel and tutors for wading into the deep waters of Javascript, JSON, Axios, and Enquirer with the class and keeping me afloat with their instruction and guidance. Thank you to my fellow classmates for including me in the study and homework sessions as working together on a problem has been a great teacher also.
